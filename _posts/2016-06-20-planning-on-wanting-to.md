# Planning on Wanting To

_"Why keep pushing and spending to chase this repetition monster down and strangle it in its den?"_

Some decisions don't get easier as you get older, especially the important ones you've delayed.

I suppose some might argue that the delayed ones just get decided by default or when you least expect it, but if you are staying curious, believe you still have options, and are planning to make a new decision, then the stakes are higher in the sense that you don't have as much time left to actualize your choices.

Others might argue that the stakes are higher when you make big decisions young, but what the young don't realize is that there's still time to change your openness to changing your mind, whereas when you're older, what you also change is your openness to dying with big losses of various kinds.

My husband and I are contemplating a huge transition in our lives in more than one way. We want to make good choices, not habitual ones, so we're working down through the layers of assumptions. We need to get to the bottom of things.

Challenging assumptions is something I've spent most of my professional career doing with other people, and I do it often myself, but the propensity for fooling myself is still sneaky, like a jack-in-the-box.

I'd call it whacking moles, except then you'd be calling my writing clich√©d and we can't have that.

And besides, whacking moles isn't right anyway. That's a harried process of putting out fires. This is a process of smothering the fire of "make this decision quick!" and then digging under the ashes to find the fuel that been relighting in the same place for so long. 

Here's what I'm talking about:

What are our personal fires? Repeating patterns in our lives like finding oneself in the same kind of relationship over and over again despite having married apparently very different people, or ending up in the same argument with serial bosses and leaving in a huff. 

All this huffing and divorcing can be so upsetting that many people just fail to learn the lessons right in front of their faces and run to the next opportunity to try to do it better somehow.

Usually, without some conscious effort to observe and learn about the psychological causes, you're back in the saddle riding the same horse in a different landscape. Yes, the details are mostly psychological. No I'm not saying there are no other components. And guess whose psychology we're talking about? 

Saddles, fires, it's a mixed metaphor, just hang on, that's the way life is.

It can be hard work to figure this stuff out, why you're doing this stuff over and over again, making the same choices unconsciously, which is making the same mistakes, coming up empty again with a craving for something -- success, a good parent, belonging, safety -- that you rush into the next thing to find it. 

There are tools that can help, many new tools, in the form of better health practices to get you grounded and with more traction, better tools in the form of new approaches for tangling successfully with your habits, and a lot more in our shared culture to help you because now more of us accept these as worthy goals. But that is not the subject of this piece.

The point here is, why bother, why keep at it? Why keep pushing and spending to chase this repetition monster down and strangle it in its den?

Because if you don't do it, all you will have is cravings, and you will not have simple desire.

You will be an automaton, as I have, for many years of my life, and completely lose track of or never find anything that _really_ matters to you, that has a chance of truly sustaining you in your life.

You will be doomed to sleepwalking, moving like a robot, waiting for the next person to push your buttons. You are not really living.

What's the difference between craving and desire?

Cravings are satisfied only briefly and then they recur. Just like withdrawal from a drug. Some cravings are for things we absolutely need, like water, and others are for things we've come to believe we absolutely need.

Desire is a more generative, creative feeling, one that's intrinsically sustaining. With desire you feel alive, with craving you feel desperate, disabled, preoccupied.

(So where does lust fall in this typology? A topic for another post.)

Much of my life is still powered by fear. I'm not proud of this. I'm far from an exemplar of human perfection. Fortunately, I don't need to be such an exemplar in order to be helpful -- or so I hear; besides, you probably have a lot of those exemplar people running around in your life already, on TV, in the self-help literature. 

I guess I'm going the route of the supermarket tabloids, where so many people find comfort in the knowledge that the people they've been idolizing are really kind of in the soup, as Carl Jung would say, the way they are.

Yeah, I'd love to hear the Dalai Lama on his off days too.

Just plain wanting is hard for me these days. Wanting to do something, wanting to have something, wanting to create something. I still find myself reverting to bad habits, and cluttering my mind with things I think I should be doing.

Yet, on what many consider to be the downward slope of their lives, in terms of years, I am not feeling downward, I am feeling upward. I've been riding at the back of the waves, the person who usually sees the forming curve, but who, for a host of complex reasons, has not paddled to ride the crests. I know that somewhere in here I've got the juice and so I've kept pace at a short distance, reading the signs, getting pulled along from roller to roller, watching, thinking, and holding back. 

I know I'm coming up to an opportunity to make some really interesting and important choices and that's going to require being much clearer than I've been, than we've been, about some stuff we've been talking about for a while.

My project is now is to get out that big heavy shovel again, go back to those steaming embers, thrust in the blade and toss the detritus aside to see what lies or runs beneath.

Fuck you, mixed metaphors, just do as I say.
