# **The No-Go Zone**

The no-go zone is where you always are, almost.

It's what you circle with your back to it, your legs slightly warm from the knowledge that what's behind you can sear the core out of your daily life. The thing is, it already has.

---

It hardly helps to know this, because you still do it. You still recruit all your mental capacities on a 24-hour shift to hold that magma in check.

Unless you can't quite keep your guard up at night and the dreams squeak out. Or they ooze out. Or stampede out.

Did you know that dreams tend to happen in real time? Meaning that the length of a dream maps on pretty closely to actual time that someone else is keeping as they watch your eyes flit around in your head?

That means that those minutes are actual minutes in which your conscious mind has said to you, "Yer on yer own, big guy. I'm on break."

A dear friend of mine just stopped taking her antidepressants after 20 years on them. She's been doing the backward-glance dance for a long time.

It's not hard to understand. The feelings that are caged back there threaten to tear your guts out. And frankly, it's not much fun to stay in a chronic state of acute grief for long periods of time. But I suspect it's worse to stay emotionally dead for long periods of time, which is what depression is.

Of course, it's a lot more than that. It's resistance to life, it's loss of opportunity, it's the attenuation of relationships.

It's like turning your light off and pretending no one's home.

You do it because you're tending that hot, bright lava of grief or rage behind you and sometimes you're not sure if it's yourself you're protecting or everyone else around you.

Physically, depression is a lot more than that. When you're clinically depressed, you're not interested in food or sex, you don't enjoy much, and you don't sleep so well.

It's like your whole body is on a single mission to keep something very deep and out of the way and it takes everything you've got to do that. That's depression that results from deep emotional insult.

There are probably many causes of depression that needn't be attributed, as people are often tempted to do, to emotions.

There's a lot of new science about this.

The jury is still out on my personal experience with depression.

I still wonder whether many of the difficulties I've had in life are a byproduct of digestive problems of various kinds which are now known to play havoc with your endocrine system (Hormones. There they are again.)

Chances are there's been a vicious cycle, in which my personality and defensive style combined with the chronic burden of neuromuscular and digestive problems helped keep me in a closed feedback loop perpetuating my emotional and cognitive problems.

Sounds official doesn't it?

Well, sure. I didn't earn multiple degrees without gaining the ability to distance myself from my experience with technical language. What kind of professional would I be?

(_That's a joke, BTW. No good professional should treat a patient that way but we do at times, and also treat ourselves that way surprisingly often._)

Yup, that's probably one of many reasons I left my therapist's chair, to see what real life was like. I had to break the cycle somehow and the world I was operating in was not helping me.
