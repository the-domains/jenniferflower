Out of the Frying Pan into the Crucible

A lot of people make a living from knowing what's going on. Or at least sussing it out to the best of their ability.

Take my husband, for example. He does a great job at that.

People in my old profession of [psychodynamic psychotherapy][0] spend a lot of time straining not to know what's going on.

That's because as soon as you know what's going on, your patient recoils into a state of alienation and waits for you to get over it. Hopes you'll get over it.

That's because what's happened is you've left the territory of exploring their reality and you've come crashing in with yours, which is the source of your certainty.

And that's because unless you're living their life, you just can't be certain of much because you don't know what else in their minds this particular moment is tied to and that you haven't learned about yet.

There are a very few times when your knowing what's going on can be enormously reassuring to a patient. But there's often blowback later because they soon revisit the question, as they should, from a different point of view and you start to look like someone who just doesn't, can't understand them. 

Actually, all the blowback means is that you then labor through a process of checking and exploring and untangling and differentiating: Are you just as clueless as all the other people in their lives who have misunderstand them? 

Which is doing what we call working in the negative transference, meaning that to the patient, you the therapist become again the bad mother or father (or someone important to them) who never got them instead of the good mom or dad who did (often the same person on another occasion).

Many people consider this the most important and powerful part of the treatment because the two of you are now pushing against the fixed ideas they have in their minds about how the world just doesn't get them, and if it weren't for that they could have a good life. Or something similar.

This is the stage when you're repairing another layer of injuries that have been reinjured for most of their lives. And over the course of their lives these various experiences have been linked to a lot of other ones.

You are working through a web of mental associations which often have unexpected qualities and destinations.

All this doesn't mean you shouldn't know anything or share anything you know, you just have to be mindful that in this game there are many sides to the same story. There have to be because you're in the business of helping someone change the rigid story that is ruining their life to another plausible story that gradually makes more sense for the life they're longing to live now. 

The story evolves. Neither of you knows what it's going to be yet.

My point here is that there are just way more unforeseen consequences to most things than most people realize.

That's because we're all busy telling ourselves we've got or at least can get things under control.

And a casual decision to take an important process to an early vote is not going to settle the question easily or, possibly, well.

But nor will a well considered decision to take an important process to what seems to be a timely vote.

And then what?Well, exactly. What? You just don't know.

Maybe the European Union will take you back. Maybe they won't.

I had a conversation some time ago with a young man who was very concerned about something someone a lot older was doing.He was sure it couldn't end well because he is in the business of assuring himself that he will be able to keep things under control. He's very afraid that he won't.

All I could think of to say at the time was that it's much harder to know in advance which is a good and which is a bad decision. That's because there are too many variables to control and the role of luck and experience you don't have yet will later demonstrate to you at least a few of those scenarios you hadn't considered or wanted to minimize.

Playing it safe often isn't. And playing it safe makes some people feel dreadful. Dead, for example.

If I could have remembered it well enough, I'd have told him the following Chinese story, which I'm now paraphrasing (I'd love it if you know this story and tweet me the site where I might find it @JenniferFlower):

_There once was a farmer who had a son. One day a beautiful wild horse roamed into the farmers gate. And the farmer made the horse his own._

_His neighbors came by and congratulated him, "Oh, what good fortune, you have a new horse!"_

_The farmer said, "Well, we'll see."_

_Soon the son was out taming the horse. One day he mounted the horse and rode him. But the horse threw him and the son's leg was broken._

_The neighbors came by and gave their condolences, "Oh what bad luck, your son has broken his leg!"_

_The farmer said, "Well, we'll see."_

_Soon there were rumors of a conflict with a neighboring nation. Then war was declared and within days the army sent a delegation round to each of the families, conscripting their healthy sons._

_But they passed over the farmer's son because his leg was broken._

_The neighbors came by and congratulated the farmer, "Oh what luck! Your son is exempt because of his broken leg!"_

_The farmer said, "Well, we'll see."_

_While the son was home convalescing, he was introduced to a beautiful young woman.Soon they were married._

_His neighbors cam by and congratulated the farmer, "Oh what good luck, your son has found a good wife!"_

_The farmer said, "Well, we'll see."_

_Years passed and the young couple soon had a child.But a deadly disease swept the community and soon both mother and child were dead._

_The neighbors came by and commiserated with him, "Oh what terrible luck, you have lost your daughter and grandchild!"_

_He said, "Well, we'll see."_

See where I'm going with this?

Many of us have a horror of making mistakes.I certainly do sometimes.But there's just not much we can do about it, I'm afraid. Yes, afraid, but because I'm not all that evolved myself. 

I'm afraid and I have to keep moving and living and loving and they all involve taking chances.

Sure, we make our best calls, based on our tolerance for risk, and a longing to feel life thrumming in our chest.

Sometimes we make it. Sometimes we just fall flat on our faces.

I'm working on getting up faster. And getting on with it more and more vividly.

This is my path. What is yours? (@JenniferFlower)
