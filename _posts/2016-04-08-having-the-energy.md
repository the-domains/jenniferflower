# Having the Energy

_"Truth is not the starting point, despite what many purists tell you."_

Wow, this Influenza B virus is a doozy. It's been over two weeks and I'm still a wet dishrag.

My husband is feeling a little better than I am but he has a much more aggressive immune system. And a purer heart.

My immune system is kinda like, "Oh really? Another assault? Hang on, I'll be right with you. I'm watching a snail."

I hear this flu usually lingers for another couple of weeks, but our neighbor has been sick for four weeks and he's still getting low-grade fevers.

I've been taking C, B, D3, zinc, fermented fish oil, and an assortment of other supplements associated with getting rid of parasites.

I suspect my body is just tired of my shenanigans.

One person I know who's been sleeping with the guy and getting coughed on regularly by the guy who's had a fever for four weeks is not getting sick.

She does serious yoga. And she has clean thoughts. 

OK, well I'm not as sure about the thoughts, but she seems to have the right kind of thoughts.

And I'm not sure what that means but she has a good aura. Which I also can't quite identify.

I'm getting more and more into yoga again, which is not so controversial.

And I'm getting more and more interested in energy medicine, which is. I just don't quite know what I think about it yet.

It makes complete sense to me that electrical factors can both reveal and treat illness. Apparently, different organ systems have different electrical signatures. 

The acupuncturists in the crowd would say at this moment, "So you're just picking up on this?!"

Thousands of years of experience ought to be worth something.

I've been to acupuncturists and they've helped me a lot.

I noticed this 1993 book on the shelf, _Alternative Therapies_, that I forgot we had. I was about to donate it to the Salvation Army but first I ran down the table of contents and it had a section on energy medicine. 

It turns out there are all kinds of electrical machines for diagnosing and treating various ailments. I had just heard of a couple.

You dial up the frequencies and you apply the probe to the affected area. 

Too easy?

Why does everything have to be hard?

I mean, how do they think we're going to get to the triquarter, anyway?

When western medicine comes out with that anti-aging pill they're working on because they can patent and sell millions of it repeatedly, some people will complain it's too easy, but most people will just go the fuck out and buy it.

I have been treated by an energy medicine doctor who used kinesiology to diagnose some problems I was having. He is also a degreed chemist, nutritionist, and non-force chiropractor.

His name is Dennis O'Brien and he is a sweetheart.

Great dancer too.

He used all his skills to help me.

When I ask Dennis, whom I kiss on the head whenever possible, "So Dennis, what can I read on this subject of energy medicine?" he is remarkably silent, despite his ardent use of energy medicine.

He did steer me once to a book called _The Body Electric_. It was written in the 1980s by a physician who got turned onto energy as a therapeutic modality and then went on the campaign trail telling everyone he knew.

The problem is that some things about the way energy practitioners work is just too hard to believe for some of us.

They do diagnosis over the phone.

Long distance.

I don't know, are they using the electricity in the phone?

Is it telepathic?

Is it empathic?

So I'm thinking now about all that interesting research that's been done over decades in the Big Bad Country called the Soviet Union. Now Russia et al.

The ex-Soviets have spent a lot of time looking into paranormal phenomena and energetics along with a lot of other stuff I can't quite name.

Maybe they did it because it was cheap and they had no promise of making a mint by creating a lot of procedures and drugs they could get paid a lot for by the piece. 

There is a research department at Princeton University that has been chasing down some paranormal phenomena, but they get a lot more cred. Because they're Princeton.

But don't worry, skeptics, the Princeton folks get a lot of raised eyebrows too.

I figure it's fine to start with raised eyebrows, but if you just end there, you're not doing anyone a service. Or yourself.

I spent years in clinical training, learning to suspend my suspicions so as to be able to listen with openness. 

Openness is therapeutically functional.

Lack of suspicion is a complicated thing, though. 

There are some people who will just lie their ways through everything.

In fact, most people lie a lot more than they admit to themselves or others.

So it's not really about just sitting down and telling the truth, it's about working your way towards what's true enough to be therapeutic. (Another post someday.)

Truth is not the starting point, despite what many purists will tell you.

So I'm looking for some robust research and thoughtful, thorough writing on the subject of energy medicine. 

I'd love to get hooked up to the Russian research on energy, but I'm not sure where to start.

I don't expect truth, I expect an earnest effort to wrestle with one's own limitations, the limitations of science, and a search for truth.

If you have some good leads on this body of work, please email me at Jennifer \[at\] the change project com. Maybe we can start a conversation. Thanks in advance.

Someday, when I move this blog to a platform that actually allows comments, this will be a lot easier.
