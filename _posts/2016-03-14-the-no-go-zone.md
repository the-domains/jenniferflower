# The No-Go Zone

The no-go zone is where you always are, almost.

It's what you circle with your back to it, your butt slightly warm from the knowledge that what's behind you can sear the core out of your daily life.

The thing is, it already has.

It hardly helps to know this, because you still do it. You still recruit all your mental capacities on a 24-hour shift to keep that magma in check.

Unless you can't quite keep your guard up at night and the dreams squeak out.

Or they ooze out. Or stampede out.

Did you know that dreams tend to happen in real time?Meaning, that the length of a dream maps on pretty closely to actual time by the clock that someone else is keeping as they watch your eyes flit around in your head.

If we're keeping track, that means that those minutes are actual minutes in which your conscious mind has said to you, "Yer on yer own, big guy. I'm on break."

It's hard to get good help these days.

A dear friend of mine just stopped taking her antidepressants after 20 years on them. She's been doing this backward dance for a long time.

It's not hard to understand. The feelings that are caged back there threaten to tear your guts out.

And frankly, it's not very good for your brain to stay in a chronic state of acute grief for long periods of time. 

But I suspect it's worse to stay emotionally dead for long periods of time, which is what depression is.

Of course, it's a lot more than that. It's resistance to life, it's loss of opportunity, it's the attenuation of relationships.

It's like turning your light off and pretending no one's home.

You do it because you're tending that hot, bright lava of grief or rage (or both) behind you and sometimes you're not sure if it's yourself you're protecting or everyone else around you.

Physically, depression is a lot more than that. When you're clinically depressed, (technically meaning a level of disorder that meets diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the day) you're not interested in food or sex, you don't enjoy much, and you don't sleep so well.

It's like your whole body is on a single mission to keep something very deep and out of the way and it takes everything you've got to do that.

That's depression that results from deep emotional insult.

There are probably many causes of depression that needn't be attributed, as people are often tempted to do, to emotional causes.

There's a lot of new science about this.

The jury is still out on my personal experience with depression.

I still wonder whether many of the difficulties I've had in life are a byproduct of digestive problems of various kinds which are now known to play havoc with your endocrine system (Hormones. You think hormones have anything to do with emotions?)

Chances are there's been a vicious cycle, in which my personality and defensive style combined with the chronic burden of musculoskeletal and digestive problems helped keep me in a closed feedback loop perpetuating my emotional and cognitive problems.

Sounds official doesn't it?

Well, sure. I didn't get educated up the wazoo and come out with multiple degrees yet lack the ability to distance myself from my experience with technical language! What kind of professional would I be?

But yup, that's probably one of many reasons I left my therapist's chair to see what real life was like. I had to break the cycle somehow and the world I was operating in was not helping me.

I'll have to stew about this some more before I write about it in detail.

It's not because I don't have a lot I could say now.

It's because I'm not ready to say it. I mean, after all, this is in public.

And I'm not sure yet what would be the point.
