# What the Left Hand is Doing

When I was in graduate school there was a lot of fuss about laterality. Which hemisphere of the brain does what, that sort of thing.

You'd constantly hear the story in Psych 101 classes about the folks with split brains, meaning their hemispheres were not connected properly through the corpus collosum, a big band of fibers usually bridging one side of your brain to the other. 

Theirs didn't.

The peculiarities that arise with this type of condition are certainly entertaining reading.

Normally, if you show an image to the left eye, the signal goes to the opposite side of your brain, the hemisphere on your right. And vice versa. Then there's a lot of visual processing, moving back and forth across the corpus callosum: 

"Hey, did you see what that cat did? Wassup with that?"

But in split-brain folks it doesn't work right. The signal goes through the optic chiasm to the opposite side of your head (through a different pathway), but the visual processing doesn't make it to the other side of your brain.

So the left side doesn't get the news.

And vice versa.

[Jill Bolte Taylor][0] is famous for telling the story of the blissful result of a massive stroke to her left hemisphere, leaving her right hemisphere to run the show.

The feeling of oneness with the world was ecstatic and overwhelming.

Makes you think, doesn't it?

The left side of your brain is usually associated with linear thinking. The right side,with global-pattern thinking, with creativity.

This is a vast oversimplification.

Jill had a big goddam right-brain extravaganza.

The point is, I want one too, a massive vacation from the left side of my brain.

And I care less and less what my right hand (the one governed by the left hemisphere) is doing.

I don't care so much anymore because I'm reacting extremely to the part of my life that has already happened.

If I hadn't been trying so hard to keep my left brain in play ALL THE TIME, I would probably still enjoy my left brain.

But the left brain isn't so great at most forms of play. So I'm taking it out of the game.

My husband, Joe, is a wizard of rationality, from my point of view. But he does have a very poetic side. It's a shift for him to let it loose, but he can. The most he uses it for is intuition that is highly qualified by his rationality.

Joe has written a lovely novel that really should be published but which he never quite gets around to publishing, one way or another. 

Too distracting from his mission to help our healthcare system heal itself?

Too much of a psychic risk, perhaps? 

He used to be a poet. Not a great poet. But he's a good novelist.

He's a very moving singer. When he lets himself really occupy the song.

I suspect he would be healthier and happier if he spent some time letting that novel out, or writing another one, or singing more.

That's easy enough for me to say, though, because I have nothing at risk there. But I'm pretty sure that he's suffering for lack of right brain activity. 

I am too.

You?

I suspect there are drugs that mimic the effects of a left-brain stroke, but I'm too scared of those.

The best I can do right now is sit down here and write for an hour or two in the mornings.

The best way I can do that is by not editing myself much.

And for some reason, it only works if I actually publish what I write. 

By publishing it, I force it out of a circular brain pattern.

Now, very few people have seen this writing yet but the fact that they could engages different parts of my brain, probably some of the same parts that connect with a listener, and that allow a therapist to influence us.

For whatever reason, I'm figuring that's safe to do now, whereas for many years, it didn't feel safe at all.

I can't say I really know why.

Your brain changes as you get older. Some might say you're changing your mind, but I'm not sure those map onto each other so well.

I used to think that changing your mind was primarily a function of effort. Certainly, some of it is. Massive effort.

But I'm not into massive effort right now because a lot of what I've tried through massive effort hasn't worked very well.

I've felt for much of my life that my massive efforts to improve some things about myself really didn't get very far. Certain things happened that seemed to have a bigger effect on me and my brain:

I developed celiac disease, or something close to it.

My first parent died.

I entered perimenopause.

My second parent died.

I married my husband.

I entered menopause.

I suspect that each of these things has had a massive effect on my brain.

A theory, as my husband would say.

Theory or no, emergence from a poisonous hormonal soup or no, this is finally where I put my foot down hard.

On the left side of my brain. 

I'm watching my right brain creep off into the underbrush, checking for permanent injury, scanning for something to eat, and considering.
