# Tell Me a Story I Can't Refuse

I've been collecting titles. I keep them for when the urge strikes me. I either have the urge to add one, or I have the ... oh wait a minute, I haven't had the urge to use one. 

How long's it been? Years?

Titles are nodes. They crystallize something you don't know what. You may never know but you certainly won't know until you use one.  

Preserving potential has a deep power. It's much better than actualizing potential because it means we have a secret. And the secret is ... can't say. 

But neither can you. You can't say anything about my secret because, that's right, it's a secret. I get to be smug about it, defensive about it, distracted by it, and confused by it.  

I'm confused because I forget what it is or what it's for or why bother.

If I wait long enough, the secret may be ripening to an even bigger and better and more vivid and important and immeasurable secret.

Or it may be rotting in a corner, oozing puss and maggots.

I wouldn't even know.

The stakes get higher the longer you keep your secret. 

And the maintenance! My god, the maintenance on these things is a beast. 

You don't know what a secret really needs in order to preserve it well because, as I mentioned before, you don't know what it is. Do I feed it with peachy sunsets and burbling brooks? Or do I stoke it with gorey footage and vicious gossip? 

Do I need to spend a lot of time alone? Or do I force myself to be with other people because, after all, I'm eating for two?

I'm eating experience. And I don't get enough when I'm by myself.

Opening the door to the secret and coaxing it out, or just turning my back in the hopes that it will skulk out, hoping not to be seen ... it's not a sure thing either way.  

I don't even know that I'll leave the door open long enough. I might end up closing the door before the hind legs of my secret -- in my case, probably cousin to a Two-toed Sloth -- manages to clear the area. 

I could end up with the business end of my secret locked up again for all eternity because I didn't have the patience to wait!

But I've waited aaalllllll this tiiiiiiime!!

What can the foreparts of my secret do without the hind parts? Will I have impaired my chances before I've even gotten going?

Yes.  

I have impaired my chances before I've even gotten going because the door is still mostly closed. 

Except for the sibilance of my caged secret losing air.  

I don't have much more time left. I don't think.

That's part of it. Not thinking.

You have to be careful how you think when you have a secret. 

Some people don't think because they have a big scary secret that only they know and they have to think around it so they don't have to live with it every day.

After all, you're most of the company you keep and when you have to live with a big hairy monster secret all the time, it's like being trapped in a room on an electrified floor.

That's not the kind of secret I'm talking about.

I'm talking about the kind of secret that's a secret from you. 

Chances are, it's very very old. And often you can tell, it's probably not a big hairy monster.

It's what's possible. 

It's knowing what's possible.

It's being afraid to find out what's possible.

And therefore what's not.

But that's not all it is! Don't listen to people who tell you that. That's a vast oversimplification of secretude. 

If that were all it is, there would be no fun in letting it out.

And I can say for sure that whatever the disappointments are that accompany your liberated secret, there is delight and fun that comes along with it.

Or so I hear.
