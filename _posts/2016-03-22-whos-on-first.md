# Who's on First?

Overnight, liquor seeps into the little cavities between
what I'm going to do and actually doing it, between what I was thinking about
and why.

The decisions I made yesterday are back on the table.

Caffeine hangs around me for days instead of hours, alcohol pickles my ideas and makes my head weigh
about twice as much as any head should. 

The next morning I have slightly less will to live than
usual.

The older you get, and the more you let slip, the harder it
is to judge what's usual.

There are a lot of people out there bravely shaking up usual
-- Tim Ferriss, Dave Asprey, I could name quite a few.

The thing is, most of them have not been old yet.

Only Ray Kurzweil has been old, but frankly, he's just way
out there on the scale of what he'll do and how early he started.

Could someone direct me to some old people who have
redefined usual using some of the new methods? By old, I mean old people
by young people's standards but not by ours. Like 50s. 60s. 70s.

Boomers.

And I don't mean professional athletes. Anyone who has
dedicated their life to the constant improvement of their physical performance
is not a fair comparison to most of the rest of us who have been living lives
of the mind and a few other things besides.

What I want is someone about my age who's doing quite well,
thank you, while fighting a load of genetic opposition, and handling the
exigencies of daily life with a job, maybe kids, and a partner who's not that
interested in making many sacrifices of habit to feel a hell of a lot better.

My impression is it's really simple. You just do a little High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) and yoga, you take a few supplements, you drink Bulletproof
coffee, and you eat like a caveman, but not slavishly.

If I didn't already have some problems to be solved, that
would be easy.

But I've got passengers and when you've got passengers it changes the equation.

Passengers are notoriously difficult to identify via
testing. If they don't want to be found, they will make it very hard for you to
find them. 

They'll hang out in the crevices of your gut and
god-knows-where-else, rolled up into some kind of impenetrable slime while
they're under assault, and they won't come out until they need to, when there's
a profusion of simple carbohydrates out there and then they will double,
triple, in numbers.

I am always reminded of the scenes in the first Matrix
movie, where the rebels are in their hovercraft in the bowels of the system
and then they hear a Sentinel, a bug-like drone with tentacles, coming in search
to destroy them. The rebels shut down their engines and stay
reaaalllly reaaalllly quiet until the Sentinel moves on. The rebels are the
good guys in the Matrix.

In my body, the rebels are the bad guys -- yeast, parasites,
unfriendly bacteria, I don't know exactly who they are, but right now I feel like I have a host of these aliens inside me who are not welcome.

DO YOU HEAR ME, ALIENS?

Unfortunately, they're right and I'm wrong. For most of my life they actually have been
welcome in the sense that my body has never put up enough of a fight, automatically, to keep them out. I have to keep fighting, over and over again.

Some of us are just too receptive.

I was too receptive to sperm, too.

Despite several forms of otherwise highly effective
contraceptives, I got pregnant more than once.

The doctors examining me were impressed.

So what are we talking about here?

That's the question that an interpersonal psychoanalyst is
taught to ask very early in their training:

"What's going on around here?"

It's different from what a Freudian psychoanalyst would ask.
I don't know exactly how the Freudians would put it, you'd have to ask a few of
them.

You'd have to ask a few of them because psychoanalysts are
not of one mind. They rebel against coercion, except often not enough, and
they're constantly asking questions. Pains in the ass.

What's different about the interpersonalist's question is
that it's a genuine question about the field. I mean field in the same way that theorists refer to Field Theory.

Interpersonalists are not just interested in your unconscious process --
which is notoriously impossible to report on directly -- we're asking about your
environment.

What, as far as you can see, is going on around you?

What does it look like to you, and what does it look like to
me, and what do other people say about it?

We're ready to hear a lot of versions of this over a period
of time. That's the way brains work. They change themselves, that is your mind, with
each recall, each telling.

That's how psychoanalysis works. It gives you the chance to
change your mind by telling, by asking pain-in-the-ass questions, and by retelling.
It actually changes your brain.

So, to get back to my point. How do I make sense of what
feels like a lifelong vulnerability to hostile occupation? Not by assault, but
by stealth? An occupation in which teeny tiny life forms take up residence in small ways, right alongside the ones that are supposed to be there, and
gradually make their homes in me for the long haul?

I don't notice them until they've gained in numbers and have
established habits.

Now, there are versions of this reality that have to do with
physical properties and circumstances that predispose you to infection, like
many years on and off antibiotics that purge you of the healthy flora in your
gut, along with whatever hostile entities may have been plaguing you, to the point
where you never really reestablish the internal conditions that routinely ward
off invaders.

The problems with ingesting too many antibiotics (directly or indirectly) have been well studied and documented. That we've been taking way too many antibiotics is not a
subject of much controversy any more. It's one of the reasons we, as a society, have been
cracking down on the unnecessary use of antibiotics in our food supply.

What's always controversial is the relationship between, on
the one hand, your brain, including what you were born with and how you're
changing it through exposure to chemicals and other physical properties, and on
the other hand, your mind, your psychology.

Most people like to think of them as separate, even when
they claim they don't think of them as separate. It's a Western Mind habit to
differentiate between your mind and your brain as though they were two
different causes.

But that's silly, isn't it?

Think about Toxoplasmosis, the bug that infects many cats
and rats and people, to name a few. It changes how animals behave in order to
make its own reproduction more likely.

So the feeling I often have, when I've got a lot of
passengers on board -- as against when I have fewer -- that my mood is different,
my thinking is slightly different, and I crave carbohydrates -- that's not
crazy, that's a rational inference from a lot of new science.

Listen to [Ed Yong on the TED Hour episode called
Hidden][0]. He talks about this at
length. I'm going to have to read his
book, _I Contain Multitudes_, which is due out in August. 

I'm going to have to, no matter what my passengers say. But
who knows, maybe my passengers want me to get to know them better and that's why I want to read it?

I'm going to have to read it because I've made up my mind.

For now.
