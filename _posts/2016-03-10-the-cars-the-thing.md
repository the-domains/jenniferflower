# The Car's the Thing

So it's come to this. All roads pointing. 

To the car.

Many of us know that we just prefer vehicles to almost anything else you can occupy. More than those stick-built things stuck in the mud, or concrete sandwiches among many other sandwiches of concrete.

We know we like the sense that we're going somewhere, or if we're not right now, then we could be soon.

We know how easy it is to turn the key.

Right now, Joe and I only own vehicles. No, I agree it's not a good financial decision.

Unless you count the feeling we have had from each of our cars, RVs, and boats. Each had a different flavor, had been somewhere the others had not went (yes dear, I know that's not grammatical).

Did I mention they were all well used when we bought them?

Can you count feeling into a financial decision? Not easily.

That's the problem with measuring. The results are often disappointing.

Measuring is not a good substitute for ... everything.

Judging from the productivity literature, you could well have arrived at this point in your life believing that measuring is what you should be living for.

Oh, but then there's the other camp, the Seth Godin camp, which is quite large, which resists incrementalism and embraces art.

I'd have to say I'm in the art camp, but I doubt he means that we shouldn't measure anything. He just warns against trying to incrementalize your way to success.

But I digress.

Small surprise because digressing is the point of vehicles.

The gress is always greener.

That's why we need them.

But here's an important distinction: You can use your car to chase after greener pastures. Or you can use your car to find green pastures.

For example, I got up this morning fully expecting to get out of the house early and get to the cafe where I have written many pieces over many years.

OK, well, not that many.

Then I had to take a bath. I just had to because it was getting ridiculous. 

I won't go into detail.

Then I had to put a laundry in the washing machine.

Then I had to make my Bulletproof Coffee.

Then I had to make some eggs because sometimes coffee hurts my stomach.

Then I had to put the laundry in the dryer.

And the time kept slipping away. I had to be home by 10:00 a.m. and it was getting nearer to 10 with every gress I took.

So I filled my bags with crap. I never miss a trip from the tugboat. I always take a load of crap with me on my way out to give or throw away.

And I humped it down to the car.

And then it was 9:00 am. And the cafe is crowded and noisy at 9 a.m. and I wouldn't get a good seat.

I've spent other mornings Going in Search of the Right Cafe and failing to write a thing.

But I've turned over a new leaf.

So here I am, drinking my Bulletproof Coffee, and writing. 

In the car.

Where it's quiet.

And full of possibility.
