# A Gentler Kind of Learning

The farther into academia you get, the more you have a choice about how much drubbing you want.

You earn the right to say, "No thank you. That will be enough drubbing for now."

That's old-school education by the way. I wish I could enter some innovative magnet school in the woods at the age of 2 where we recognize the primary value of creativity.

In most education, we're still running the machine. We've got the assembly line threading its way through our lives like a poisonous river: We need to drink but what we really need is to swim as fast and as strong as we can before we need to drink too much.

It starts early for most people, maybe at day care which, be honest, is mostly pleasant active storage, if we're lucky. 

Of course that's not true for everyone. There are some kids getting a great experience in day care.

If we could only see what goes on in day care, day in, day out.

Fortunately for the kids in storage day care, it only lasts a year to three, usually. But what important years they are!

And unfortunately for the kids in great day care, it only lasts a year to three. Then, chances are, they enter the drubbing phase.

Which can last an awfully long time.

It's all about fitting in.

I often marvel at how well behaved most people are, even under pretty stressful circumstances. 

It's probably because that shaming, shaping "Behave yourself!" lesson started to take hold when we realized so many goodies depended on it.

No, the injunction isn't always intrinsically shaming. Shaming shows up in the desperation of parents, from their need not to be shamed by having a disobedient child.

That and guilt, the internalized "uh ohhhhh!" which if done right can be a game for identifying behaviors that need to be improved and if done punitively can poison your internal life.

We've all got to learn to get along in this world. The burdens that parents shoulder these days are huge for making sure their children are safe, assimilable, and appealing.

Appealing is important. It used to be the single biggest predictor of success in therapy as a child, whether you're an appealing little boy or girl or somewhere in between, loosely speaking.

Appealing means that people have not already doused all the light you were born with.

You need at least a little light for early traction in therapy.

If you get a good start in life, that helps ward off the need for therapy later. 

It's too bad that it's the kid getting therapy, because it's really the system that needs it.

And the system has been getting a little more of it every year from people who recognize how important it is to train kids for independence and creativity, not so much for obedience.

But, you may counter, we can't all be independent and creative and sacrifice obedience. That's a class privilege. The rest of us have to suck it up and get along.

I didn't say sacrifice obedience. I said not so much. But it's even more important for people without power to learn a way to shape their own realities that doesn't get them into big bad trouble.

In some ways it's a class privilege or at least a class opportunity in the sense that in order to achieve a higher economic class via entrepreneurship or ladder-scaling, you've got to get this independence/creativity thing down. 

No, I'm not getting into the issue of whether there should be classes at all. I do feel there should at least be a lot fewer differences among the classes.

What about all those folks in our society who just barely manage by keeping their heads down? The cogs in the machine?

I don't know. I am sure that the kind of dehumanization that goes on in our culture is not necessary.

I don't know exactly what the right balance is between training obedience and training creativity.

But I'm not too worried: we have a long way to go before our public education system is leaning too hard on the independence and creativity side and away from obedience as the vaunted value.

Before we go too much farther though, let's check on our definition of independence. One kind of independence, it's true, is a class privilege for the few who take it and run with it. 

Let's talk about independence of mind, then: the mind's ability to value itself, its ideas, the importance of contributing, and of doing it with originality and mental toughness (by which I mean strength and occasional obduracy). 

Independence is not unqualified freedom.

I want to say that the choice we have to make is between inculcation and evocation, but that's not quite right because the process of evoking is a form of inculcating a value.  (Isn't that what we always do with values? Inculcate them?)

We're inculcating the value of emergence instead of the value of swallowing whoever you were starting to feel yourself to be in favor of being someone the others want you to be.

The Montessori folks have the right idea about this. I'm not expert on Montessori either, I'm just talking about the idea of inviting what's inside the child instead of rote-training it out. 

What makes for better adaptability, when you hammer less on obedience, is how to read the signals, and many of those signals are sent by people at higher class levels.  

Whatever level you're operating at, emotional literacy, that is, how to read your own emotions and the emotions of others, is going to be key in determining how flexibly and successfully you move among situations. 

Emotional literacy is taught way too infrequently, Sesame Street notwithstanding.

If you were to rely entirely on a Sesame Street level of emotional literacy, you would fail at some of the most important life challenges -- reading motivation, layered meanings, appreciating the role and inevitability of ambivalence, and identifying psychopathology early in yourself and others, if just by feel.

One kind of psychopathology we could all learn to identify a lot earlier is psychopathy.  Psychopaths have enough emotional literacy to play you. If you're psychologically naive, you will be their mark. 

Look around you. I bet there are more psychopaths per square inch in leadership of various kinds than in many other social positions.

So, the choice between obedience and independence/creativity is a forced choice.  The emotional learning that many of us never do is a mediating power in all this, to minimize the brutality that's inevitable in life, to increase our ability to manage ourselves sympathetically and to manage others empathically, and to recast the realities we are handed into other realities. 

And the cogs? The peons? The obedient? What if we are each part of a team and the team does a critical part of the work that we all need, through which as much responsibility is devolved, a la lean manufacturing, to the people on the line, so that more of the team has input and initiative that evolve the process?

No, this is not a substitute for challenging abusive or unfair business practices, that still needs to happen. My point here is to re-see something, to unyoke the question of how we raise people to think clearly and for themselves from the fallacious idea that some of us have to be automatons.

Besides. Aren't we busy devising a new population of automatons? Who have no human rights because they're machines?  So doesn't that leave us with an even more urgent project, to recognize the unique and valuable contributions that the humans among us can make?

What you're doing when you study emotional literacy is making your world safe for your own emergence as a human being with human gifts.

The alternative to emergence? Drubbing.
