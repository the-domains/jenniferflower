# A Gentler Kind of Learning

The farther into academia you get, the more you have a choice about how much drubbing you want.

You earn the right to say, "No thank you. That will be enough drubbing for now."

That's old-school education by the way. I wish I could enter some innovative magnet school in the woods at the age of 2 where we recognize the primary value of creativity.

In most education, we're still running the machine. We've got the assembly line threading its way through our lives like a poisonous river: We need to drink but what we really need is to swim as fast and as strong as we can before we need to drink too much.

It starts early for most people, maybe at day care which, be honest, is mostly pleasant active storage, if we're lucky. 

Of course that's not true for everyone. There are some kids getting a great experience in day care.

If we could only see what goes on in day care, day in, day out.

Fortunately for the kids in storage day care, it only lasts a year to three, usually. But what important years they are!

And unfortunately for the kids in great day care, it only lasts a year to three. Then, chances are, they enter the drubbing phase.

Which can last an awfully long time.

It's all about fitting in, I hear.

I often marvel at how well behaved most people are, even under pretty stressful circumstances. 

It's probably because that shaming, shaping "Behave yourself!" lesson started to take hold when we realized so much good stuff depended on it.

No, the injunction isn't intrinsically shaming. It's the urgency and desperation that comes to attach itself from our parents, from their need not to be shamed by having a disobedient child.

That and guilt, the internalized "uh ohhhhh!"

Maybe it is intrinsically shaming.

Anyway, we've all got to learn to get along in this world. The burdens that parents shoulder these days are huge for making sure their children are safe, assimilable, and appealing.

Appealing is important. It used to be the single biggest predictor of success in therapy as a child, whether you're an appealing little boy or girl.

That means the someone has not already doused all the light that you were born with inside you.

You need at least a little light for early traction in therapy.

If you get a good start in life, though, that helps ward off the need for therapy later. It's too bad that it's the kid getting therapy, because it's really the system that needs it.

And the system's been getting a little more of it every year from people who recognize how important it is to train kids for independence and generativity, not so much for obedience.

But, you may counter, we can't all be independent and generative and sacrifice obedience. That's a class privilege. The rest of us have to suck it up and get along.

I didn't say sacrifice obedience. I said not so much. 

I agree that in some ways it's a class privilege in the sense that in order to achieve a higher economic class via entrepreneurship,  you've got to get this independence/generativity thing down. 

And you need to it distinguish yourself from others in business or the arts who have fewer ideas and less boldness to share them in the right time and the right place, which are not so easy to determine.

And then there are a lot of other folks in our society who barely manage by keeping their heads down. They're the cogs in the machine.

But is that the way it has to be?

So no, I don't know exactly what the right balance is. And anyway, what would a society full of people who all have the same qualities look like?  

I guess people always vary and we don't have to worry too much about being identical.

We have a long way to go before our public education system is leaning too hard on the independence and generativity side and away from obedience.

Before we go too much farther though, let's check on our definition of independence. One kind of independence is not a class privilege for the few who take it and run with it. 

To me, independence of mind is the mind's ability to value itself, its ideas, the importance of contributing, and of doing it with originality and mental toughness (by which I mean strength, not obduracy). 

Independence is not unqualified freedom.

I want to say that the choice we have to make is between inculcation and evocation, but that's not quite right because the process of evoking is a form of inculcating a value.  (Isn't that what we always do with values? Inculcate them?)

We're inculcating the value of emerging instead of swallowing whoever you were starting to feel yourself to be in favor of being someone the others want you to be.

So what's the alternative? 

Emergence.

The Montessori folks have the right idea about this. I'm not expert on Montessori either, I'm just talking about the idea of inviting what's inside the child instead of rote-training it out.

There are some things I know about it, some things I'm learning about it, and some things about emergence that I'm working on behind the scenes.

Under this mask I'm wearing.
