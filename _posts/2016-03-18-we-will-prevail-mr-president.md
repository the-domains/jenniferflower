# "We Will Prevail," Mr. President

She wants a check.

Nikki Giovanni knows the value of her words.

They are not metaphorical where checks are concerned.

She wants it now. On the table.

No extra ifs ands or buts.

Nikki Giovanni wants space.

She'll take it when the time comes but she really wants it now.

Space is not metaphorical where Nikki is concerned.

It's where we are and where we need to be.

It's what we've got to do.

All those fliers on creaky mountain porches, staring up out of their private selves

into the glorious density of space.

The place where the quiet they've been

pays dividends.

Who we are makes sense

when you take space into account.

The terrible passage was dark, mean, hopeless,

the passage, under those creaky boards.

The passage tested their silence.

So they sang.

They sang their way here

and we'll sing our way there.

(On hearing Nikki Giovanni _On Being)_
