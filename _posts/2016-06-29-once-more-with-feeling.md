# Once More With Feeling

This morning I went to my list of titles for something to write about. But I didn't know what I'd found.

I looked at the list and thought, those titles look both familiar and unfamiliar. Are they mine?

They could be mine.

They were the list of what I am planning to read.

I could have embarked on a relatively innocent writing project with someone else's title and could well have failed to notice at first that it was not my title. 

I could have done a decent job with one of those titles.

So could you.

Having come this far, I could now write a post having to do with sampling and IP, I could pursue the vagaries of multiple consciousnesses running on the same node. I could riff on what a title really is. I could ignore it, and start from the feeling I had when I noticed the one I noticed.

What about you?

We could both have found out later that we were writing about the same title. Someone else's.

We'd have made it ours, but the original author might not have seen it that way.

Our impulse would have been authentic. Our interests, say, in what we want to read next, are genuine; they proceed from some inner pattern or river of experience that we are following.

Which takes me to the next sentence which is no longer interesting to me.

Which tells me that I have run the course with someone else's title barely having used it.

There really is something about the experience of coming upon your own fresh idea -- fresh to you, that is -- and putting it on a list, and letting it stew.

It doesn't stew on the list, it stews in you.

Your own title sews together, with the loosest, filmiest thread, at first, a host of sounds, feelings, touches on your skin, flashes of insight, and the flotsam of life, and climbs out of your darkness, pulling this thread through your solar plexus.

So I'm not going to write about this title any more because it wasn't on the list and hasn't been cooking inside me.

See? I saved us both some time.
