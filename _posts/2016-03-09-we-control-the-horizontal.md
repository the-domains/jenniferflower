We Control the Horizontal

It's an inside joke. Locked in time.

We tend to think these memories are in flux, easily accessible to anyone, well documented and filed and cross-referenced.

But that only means something if someone is looking.

It's easy not to look back. I'm not sure it's any easier than it used to be, but let's consider:

We didn't always work so hard or so often.

It wasn't always a good idea. _The_ idea.

But that's now already old news.  At least a few people have written about it and a few other people have noticed it now for about 15 minutes.

That's it. Next!

Maybe when we weren't working so hard we had more time to reflect. Tell stories.  

Is this just nostalgia? 

Maybe all we did in our spare time then was wonder whether our betters were plotting against us, or the harvest was going to be good, or maybe we were probing that nagging toothache and considering whether it was worth the Big Yank.

I wonder whether memory in those days was more robust because most of us didn't have access to the kinds of filing systems we have now.

Probably some nifty young researcher is working on that question right now.

Because if they did that research more than a couple decades ago, we've already forgotten it.

Unless it's the single best outcome that supports our current argument.

Academia.

What we've got now in daily life -- as against the Ivory Tower -- is most of us accumulating a lot of stuff in our minds, tagging, color-coding, reshuffling, and optimizing.

In fact, right now, I'm wondering whether the music I'm listening to in my headphones, designed to minimize outside distraction, and make for the best internal writing environment, I'm wondering whether it's the right kind of music for eliciting the right kind of thoughts for this post.

I have some notion about what the right kind is and I am operating with concepts like filing and efficiency.

Is that what Balzac did in his French salon or local cafe, looking for just the right mix of conditions for "his kind" of writing.

How early did he decide what his kind was?

Or did he leave that to us?

Another point of research and recall.

I have to admit something. I am a lazy bugger when it comes to recall.

I've been telling myself for years that I have a lousy memory.  Who knows, maybe I once had a great memory.

But if I'm really honest, I'm only interested in facts for certain things, not for the one thing that is most important to me: evocation.

That is a bad property in a researcher.  So, despite many years of training in science, I've realized that I don't have to be a scientist. 

In fact, being a scientist has pretty much quelled the aspects of myself that I used to value most when I forced myself to get practical and train in science. 

I'm sure my friends figured that out about me a long time ago.

Not all of us have to be scientists. Professionally.

We do have to be scientists when making sense of certain kinds of data. And for some of us that is a personal phase change, a shift in our mental set that requires effort.  

To others, like my husband, it comes naturally.  And he's not even a scientist, strictly speaking -- by which academics usually mean, he doesn't have a science degree.

Academics.
