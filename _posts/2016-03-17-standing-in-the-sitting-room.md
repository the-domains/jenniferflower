# Standing in the Sitting Room

I just got bored. Always a red flag.

Until now, I've just been assuming that the way I would approach an idea here would take it's own shape naturally.

But I forgot about habit.

It was enough to break the habit of not writing. That felt huge.

But now that I've been writing for a couple of weeks, I'm remembering habits, that we have them, that I have them, and that I can get into them.

I've been ambivalent about habits all my life which would be one reason that I haven't had enough of the right ones, whatever that means, and that I've had a lot of the wrong ones, whatever that means.

Perhaps I've been choosing to hate habits when I'm trying to create them and I don't mind them when they happen automatically.

Don't those automatic ones tend to be the ones that we end up wanting to change?

I mean, because we see them as vices?

A vice is something you do that's moral or wicked. I'm not getting into wicked. I'll leave that for the witches to judge.

When I was a kid, I learned to the play the piano. 

Unfortunately, I wasn't involved in the decision as to what kind of piano and whom to learn from because I was a little kid.

I was mostly concerned with how much I'd have to practice. Another habit, if you're doing it for serious.

I wasn't sure I was doing it for serious. My parents weren't either.

Everyone just thought it was a good idea.A-child-should-have-a sort of thing.

So it was classical piano from a lady who told me to pretend my fingers were little hammers.

Wrong. On both counts.

Wrong music for me. Wrong fingers.

Later I went to a teacher who trained at [Juilliard][0] and she told me that hammers were nothing I wanted near a keyboard. I went to her from my last teacher because I was getting more serious.

All that seriousness required different fingers, so she taught me how to make my fingers flat, floaty, and flexible. All relaxed-like.

Changing my technique made playing the piano feel different, more an expression of me than an execution of a program.

I blossomed as a pianist, it allowed me to become what the music teachers of the world call "musical," meaning I embodied and expressed the emotion in music and conveyed it with a narrative quality that tends to involve the listener in it.

Did I know that's why I was hammering my hammer-fingers into floaty fingers?

No, I was doing what I was told.

I trusted her.

The irony is that it made me like classical music more, I adjusted better to what I was already doing and therefore didn't question what I was doing.

I was making strides, after all. I was better than before so that felt like progress. Well, it is progress if you define it as better.

It was so better that when it came time for me to choose a high school, I applied to two: [Fieldston][1], a college prep school; and [Music & Art][2], a public magnet school for kids specializing in the arts. Both highly competitive.

I got into both.

Was I going to be a musician or a Something Else to be Named Later but sending me to college?

It was a very difficult decision partly because I was making it as a young person who didn't know myself very well.

Part of what I didn't know was what kind of musician I could be. 

But I did know some stuff. I knew that my parents were artists and they were having a hard time, financially, despite the fact that my father had had great success in previous years, before I was born.

The theater had changed and he didn't know what kind of playwright he was going to be.

My mother hadn't acted in years and didn't know what kind of artist she could be. So she wasn't being an artist.

I had a lot of talented, successful artists in my life but none of them knew me very well and they were pretty preoccupied with their own problems.

So, knowing how hard one road was, I chose the other road. I went to prep school.

But I kept playing the piano. I was Rhona's star pupil. I could play in a way that helped me express the feelings I was having as a mixed-up teenager. She was very proud of me, so I was proud of me.

I ended up switching schools again, to Riverdale Country School up the road from Fieldston. Same education but less cliquey and much more beautiful.

And then Rhona, my piano teacher got married and I went to the teacher at Riverdale, a more serious teacher who _taught_ at Juilliard.

"Oh," he said, as he watched me play for the first time.

Well. That's very good, you're very musical (yay) but we're going to have to take you back a few books (boo).

Isn't it funny?I can't remember his name.

So Rhona was right about the fingers but, as it turned out she wasn't right about everything. 

This shift in teachers was very bad timing. It was my senior year in high school, as I recall. I was already struggling with a lot of other teenager stuff and I was on the verge of going away to college.

I can't even remember exactly what he wanted me to do differently because my life was a jumble. And in those days, you couldn't plug in your grand piano and practice in your dorm room, so I stopped playing the piano when I got to college.

Here's the thing. I had so slavishly followed my teachers and the path that I'd started on that it never occurred to me to play a different kind of piano (like an electric organ that I could have taken with me) or a different kind of music of my own choosing.

I just thought I was failing at classical piano the way I thought I was failing at a lot of other stuff, even though I got good grades and was going to a great school.

I thought I was failing at being a good version of me, but I couldn't figure out how to become a good version of me.

I didn't realize that the point was that I should be playing MY piano.

It just occurred to me that maybe Rhona was righter than this new piano teacher guy.

Holy shit, I never thought of that before.

What do we need music for?

To start with, for expression.

Others may start with classical music as a way to train their in-utero babies to wire up well, neurologically, but what I need music for is expression.

But here's the next thing. I also needed it as a way to break the rules, any rules, and so the music I needed was jazz.

I am an improviser.

None of us knew that, really, when I was growing up, because I was busy holding the household together. My mother, father, and sister were all fighting and angsting outwardly. My parents were on the verge of divorcing, from what I could tell.

I was angsting inwardly and felt somehow that one of us had to hold the family together so I became the listener.

Expression, other than piano, was just not in the cards for me at the time.

Playing classical piano drew on the most fearful aspects of my personality at the time, an outward focus, a need for order, a routine, and a reason to be at one end of the house when everyone was feeling tense and irritable at the other end.

Seth Godin, in his book [Linchpin][3], said something very interesting the other day. He was talking about the difference between artists and other people. He defines an artist as someone who uses their humanity to transform something for other people. A loose definition, relative to others, probably.

But relevant to what I'm working on here.

To Seth, (if I may call him Seth, which is what Google calls him) as he stated (which I'm paraphrasing) in passing in his [interview][4] with Tim Ferriss, a classical musician is someone who executes on something, not so much an artist, who transforms something. 

Now, I don't feel this is fair, because any artist who interprets is transforming something from what someone else started with to something of their own.

Unless they're just following orders, which is what Seth was getting at. The 2nd violin is following the conductor.

The soloist has more expressive freedom.

And the _jazz_ soloist, while working within and on the edge of traditions most of the time, is improvising in real time.

But is the jazz soloist transforming something or creating something completely new?

Depends on his listener, doesn't it? Depends on how far his listener can stretch from where he is sitting to perceiving what the artist is actually transforming.

None of us is capable of stepping so far from what already exists that we are creating something completely new.

Everything is a transformation of something that has gone before. No?

So that gets us into the question of how large your true, appreciative audience is.

Can we have an audience of one?

Of only ourselves?

Statistically speaking, if you travel too far afield from what most of us can recognize, you are no longer in the transformation business. You are in the confrontation and individuation business. Too far, and most of your listeners no longer know what the transformation is about. It appears to be mostly about the musician differentiating themself from the listener, holding some kind of secret.

So you have to decide for yourself the question of whether art is a message or a private activity.

Or you have to decide how large your true audience is.

Seth's answer to that is that there is no art without the listener, it's an interpersonal phenomenon.

To me, it's more of a sliding scale: you're deciding who and how large your audience is and whether you ever need anybody else at all or just an externalized part of your own mind, in the form of fantasy, perhaps projection (onto someone in particular).

The advent of blog-type activities makes this whole question deliciously ambiguous.

I'm writing here mostly to myself. You could argue that my fantasy reader is now the few people who have seen this blog. But the fact is, I'm not conscious of them while I'm writing.

Knowing there's a potential reader breaks the activity out of a circular brain pattern, raising the question of who that fantasy reader is.

Is it someone in particular?

Generally speaking, sometimes.

But for me, not right now, that I can see.

But if I really spend some time on it, I might be able to sketch out one or more fantasy readers.

But here's the third thing: it feels to me right now that that act of imagination would be an act of creation, not simply an act of recovery, because that's the way the mind tends to work and that's just the way it feels to me right now.

My guess is that, were I to embark on that project of description, I'd be making it up as I go along.

There is critical importance in the ambiguity of my answer, that there's no one in particular.

Which is both a deeply psychoanalytic point of view, and a deeply anti-psychoanalytic point of view.

How much do we create reality?

How much do we remember reality, a common reality that we shared, and now transform it?

Are we creating multiple realities, shifting from day to day, among which we choose, rejecting habit?

A temporary ending?
