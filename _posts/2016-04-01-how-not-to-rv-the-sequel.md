# How NOT to RV: The Sequel

Years ago I wrote a book called [How NOT to RV: An RVers Guide to RVing in the Absurd][0].It's a funny instructional book full of cautionary tales, laced with hopefulness and philosophical musings.

I published it on Amazon in a Kindle edition and it's been toddling along ever since with almost no effort from me. People keep buying it and they keep reviewing it well.

In fact they keep reviewing it so often that the inevitable regression to the mean has injured it's rankings. Whereas once before, I had an almost 5-star rating, I now have something closer to 4 stars. This is what happens when you get more and more data points, it's a statistical phenomenon. But there should be some compensation for getting such great engagement!

It seems that quite a lot of people just need to know how NOT to do it or they'll never do it at all. The book has turned out to be something of a public service because many people have come to the blog, as I asked, and told their tale of silliness, making mistakes, and having a great time anyway. That was the point!

I guess I was one of those people. I did a lot of research on RVing before I set out in my vintage Airstream motor home. One usually doesn't rely on a 16-year-old motor home without being a gearhead but that was part of the adventure for me. 

I really did set out to do it however I did it, not to do it perfectly. I just wanted to know what I might come up against.

[How NOT to RV][0] is the first in a series called the [How-NOT-to Guides][1], a series that I invited others to contribute to for a lion's share of the royalties but no one ever took me up on it.

I'm not sure why they didn't. It's probably for some of the same reasons that people don't write books.It's a pain in the ass if you don't love writing. And maybe when you're done, you don't want someone else to have any control over it.

On the other hand, if you just love writing and you can tell on yourself in a funny way and you really don't feel like doing much marketing, it's a great way to get something done and get paid for it without having to get in the weeds with the production and sequelae.

But I also kind of missed the point. I didn't really take seriously what more than a few readers asked me which was, when is the next one coming out? When do we find out what happened next in the life of this person?

I had written it as a how-to guide, but it was really a Trojan Horse for a lot more than that. It was about transformation, taking risks, and where a journey takes you.

Well, I'm still on that journey.

So I guess I'm writing the next one.

It will still be instructional. About something. But it will also be the other stuff. The what happens next.

And the invitation is still good. If you think you can write a funny hopeful guide about how NOT to do something while succeeding in teaching how TO do it by implication, then email me at jennifer (at) the change project \[dot\] com. If I accept your idea and see your writing sample, and then we sign you up, I can give you a small advance and a hefty share of the royalties, reserving some for my effort in marketing the series.

Right now, I'm just building the brand. If it gets noticeably bigger, the deal may not be so good, so try it now.

I will also be putting _How NOT to RV_ out in paperback and possibly audiobook. Many have requested it, so why the hell not?

It just takes time and I've got all the time in the world.
