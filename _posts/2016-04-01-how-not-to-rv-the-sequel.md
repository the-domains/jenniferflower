# How NOT to RV: The Sequel

I wrote a book called [How NOT to RV: An RVer's Guide to RVing in the Absurd][0]. It's a funny, instructional book full of cautionary tales, laced with hopefulness and philosophical musings.

It's been selling well on Amazon with almost no effort from me.

Apparently, quite a lot of people just need to know how NOT to do things or they'll never do them at all.

The book has turned out to be something of a public service. Many readers have come to the blog, as I asked, and told their tales of RVing tomfoolery, of making mistakes and having a great time anyway, and they report that the book helped them get out there and do that.

Yay! That was the point!

I guess I was one of those people. I did a lot of research on RVing before I set out in my vintage Airstream motor home. One usually doesn't rely on a 16-year-old motor home without being a gearhead but that was part of the adventure for me.

I set out to do it however I'd do it, not to do it perfectly. I just wanted to know what I might come up against.

[How NOT to RV][1] is the first in a series called the [How-NOT-to Guides][2], a series that I invite you to contribute to.

If you can tell on yourself in a funny way and you really don't feel like doing much marketing, it's a great way to get something done and get paid for it without having to get in the weeds with the production and sequelae.

More than a few readers have asked me, "When's the next one coming out? When do we find out what happened next in your life?"

I had written it as a how-to guide, but it was really a Trojan Horse for a lot more than that. It was about transformation, taking risks, and where a journey takes you.

Well, I'm still on that journey.

So I guess I'm writing the next one.

It will still be instructional. About how (NOT) to do something. But it will also be the other stuff. The what-happens-next.

And my invitation is still good. If you think you can write a funny hopeful guide about how NOT to do something while succeeding in teaching how TO do it by implication, then email me at jennifer (at) thechangeproject \[dot\] com, along with a 3-page sample of your writing on that subject. If I like it, I'll get in touch and we can decide on a deal that feels good to both of us.

Right now, I'm just building the brand. If the brand gets noticeably bigger, the deal may not be so good, so try it now!

I will also be putting _How NOT to RV_ out in paperback and audiobook. Many have requested it, so why the hell not?

It just takes time and we've got all the time in the world, right?
