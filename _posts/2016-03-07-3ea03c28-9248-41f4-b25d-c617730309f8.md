# Brain Cleansing

If you call it cleansing, it means you're talking about your (sacred) body. If you call it cleaning, it's about something under the rim inside your toilet.

That's an important distinction for most of us, who can begin to feel like things to ourselves, another object requiring maintenance and management. Often we do dread cleansing ourselves because it brings us up short in the face of our deterioration, and the unpleasantness we've socked away in various parts of our body, like memories and feelings we'd rather not have.

It can often feel easier to just stick it in this chair, put a laptop computer in front of it, apply well practiced pressures, and you're off to the races.

That's mostly the rat races, so far, for me.

The attachment to doing one thing after the next, putting the check in the little checkbox, or tossing out that last piece of packaging so you can take it out with the rest of the garbage, that stands in for taking care of business when taking care of business was defined by someone else a long time ago.

Despite all the self-help, reminders, and the conversations about what works best in improving your life, it's still easy to sink back into unconsciousness in which movement passes for improvement in the important things.

What were those again?

I am a remarkably unactualized person in many ways. I won't go to far into the details here so as to preserve some self-respect for getting to the end of this post.

I often point to an unfortunate combination of personality and constitutional characteristics that have made for a perfect storm of distractibility, lack of urgency, and inclination to illness. 

Then yesterday I heard an interview with [Adam Grant][0], the author of [Originals][1], in which he said that the true originals are procrastinators. That was all I needed to buoy me through the rest of the day without doing most of what I set out to do. (I did do a lot of other stuff though, I'm not a complete waste of time.)

So, the whole notion of brain cleansing appeals to me. I can feel the gunk accumulating in my brain, if, by gunk, we might mean the stuff -- could they be beta amyloid plaques? -- that interferes with quick recall of previously associated pieces of information like names, routes, and the combination of numbers that will open my bike lock.

I do believe though, that based on what I've been reading by [Chris Kresser][2], the [Bulletproof guy][3], and numerous people I've heard interviewed by [Tim Ferriss][4], that vast improvements are just around the corner.

For somebody.

Oddly, for me, brain cleansing doesn't start with the right formulation of tonics or supplements, or even the right exercise.

For me, brain cleansing starts with getting off the tugboat early in the morning, walking briskly to what is still my favorite cafe in Sausalito, [Taste of Rome.][5] Mornings, it's the homebase for wharf rats and the self-employed (often the same people).

We gather here early and set to work, quiet reading, or conversation, I, emptying the front of my brain onto this luminous page, so that what's in the back of my mind has more room to move around, stretch, get some air, and ready itself for true originality and a fresh chance at deep self-expression which, just between you and me, has been the single most important goal that I have not yet reached and which I suspect causes a lot of the other weaknesses I've been vulnerable to.

We'll see.
