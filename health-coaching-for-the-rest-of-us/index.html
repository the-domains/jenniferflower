<h1>Health Coaching For the Rest of Us?</h1><p></p><p>It’s something I do all the time in my personal life. Maybe not as well as I should.</p><p></p><p>But I still do it, almost compulsively. I try to help people learn about the new ways of getting healthy, mostly via functional medicine and body-hacking.</p><p></p><p>Does that mean I’m in perfect health? No. I have persistent health challenges. Some of them are quite difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>I’ve given up on them more than a few times. Why?</p><p><b>Time.</b></p><p>The problem is that it’s almost a full-time job learning enough to dig your way out of leaky gut, brain fog, parasite infection, fear of exercise and therefore lack of exercise, to name just a few.   </p><p></p><p>It takes time to shop and cook for the right stuff, like foods and medicines that most stores don’t have.</p><p></p><p>It takes time to learn all the contingencies to take into account, which order to do some things in, how to interpret certain symptoms when they can have multiple meanings and implications, with cross-reactivities and other factors.</p><p><b>Money. </b></p><p>And choices about money. How do you decide which is most important to spend your hard-earned dollars on? </p><p></p><p>What if you haven't the money to spare at all? What do you do? Give up completely?</p><p><b>Brain Power.</b></p><p>Every single practitioner I have read or consulted has underestimated how profoundly and pervasively brain symptoms impair some people's ability to adhere to a program. It's not that they are unaware that the brain is compromised by illness, they're sounding the alarm about that. But they're not taking it adequately into account in the way they design their programs and consulting to clients.</p><p></p><p>What happens is they draw in lots of people who are literally dying, if slowly, for this help but many people have brains that are now so compromised that they have trouble following instructions.</p><p></p><p>Take Daniel Amen's whole brain-scan thing. Take a look at some of those brains. He's the first one to tell you they're a mess. They sure look bad.</p><p>Yes, He's doing a good deed now, he's got a 6-month, free weekly program to walk people through what they have to know and do. </p><p></p><p>No, he's not paying for the supplements and scans and foods he's recommending, he's selling them, but at a discount. There's only so much the man can do!</p><p></p><p>But a lot of people are going to look at that and drop out immediately not just because of the time and money, but because their moods are sufficiently depressed, their memory and ability to plan is so bad, and they're so overwhelmed that they can't process the information.</p><p><b>I've Been At This for Years</b></p><p>What makes me break off from my own practice in self-healing is having to spend so much time on it rather than doing some of the work that’s critical to our other business. It's been the single biggest factor in preventing me from starting a new business of my own.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, if I were healthier, doing everything I want to do would be a lot easier.</p><p></p><p>So I say to myself, I say, “What if you just made it your business? Then you’d be working on yourself and your business at the same time.”</p><p></p><p>Isn’t that what I did by going to graduate school? But that took a looooooong time.</p><p></p><p>Isn't that what most coaches are doing anyway? Working on themselves? They're all just at different levels. Maybe the most successful ones are at the most advanced levels.</p><p></p><p><b>Gotta Be Ripped?</b></p><p>Do you have to be at an advanced level to be a successful coach?</p><p></p><p>I've already spent a lot of time learning about functional medicine.</p><p></p><p>Coaching is not the direction I was planning to go, and frankly, my memory is not my strong point. I’m not sure I’m the person to remember all the stuff that multiple other people need to take into consideration, let alone myself.</p><p></p><p>And building a practice is not easy.</p><p></p><p>Building any business is not easy.</p><p></p><p>I’m continually trying to find time to build my own business alongside our main business which is consulting and speaking on the future of healthcare.</p><p></p><p>Now I’m dangerously close to being able to create my own business.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Partly because my brain is healthier now, I've been working on it. But it has a long way to go.</p><p>How can I be a health coach and not look like the picture of health already? I’m not sure I can.</p><p>I’d like to claim that all those robust people health-coaching just haven’t been there. But they have. They have been through the ringer, often worse ringers than I have. Most of them, from the sound of it, have triumphed over more than I have, medically speaking.</p><p></p><p>But maybe they haven't, psychologically speaking.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't it matter which part of your brain is compromised?</p><p></p><p>In all those brain scans don't we see that the damage is somewhat variable? </p><p></p><p>Frontal lobe damage - difficulty planning and executing</p><p></p><p>Limbic system damage - difficulty regulating emotions, poor memory.</p><p></p><p>You can see this in the scans. Doesn't it have huge implications for whether someone can actually do what it takes to get healthy? To feel like they can? To stay focused and motivated?</p><p></p><p><b>The Rest of Us</b></p><p>There is a large group of us who, for what I suspect are brain reasons, have a great deal of difficulty deploying these functional medicine approaches. They get left behind in the rubble, on the sofa, at the bar. It’s just too hard for us to leap ahead spectacularly the way the ones in the news do.</p><p></p><p>What do we do about these people? Us?</p><p></p><p>I'm a clinical psychologist and interpersonal analyst, trained at some of the best schools in the country. I know well that you can't make headway mentally without making headway physically. They're just too intertwined. They're the same thing, for the most part.</p><p></p><p>As soon as you get a traumatic brain injury, there are a physical consequences. As soon as you get an infection in your gut there are mental consequences. And the reciprocal effects of brain and gut and too numerous to get into here.</p><p></p><p>Sure. You can read all the books you want – The Bulletproof Diet, Why Isn't My Brain Working? Wheat Belly, and on and on – but if you can't find a process gradual enough for you to implement this knowledge, hell, if you can't find a gradual enough process to just read and assimilate the stuff, you are out on your ass, blaming yourself, blaming others.</p><p></p><p>I have been up and down all my life, weight-wise, mood-wise, cognition-wise. I know how difficult this is and that the picture is not sunny for most people. It's way too hard to do a lot of this stuff for most people.</p><p></p><p>But I also know that part of this is not having the guidance and support that takes the mental challenge fully into account. People need help chunking things down, they need systematic help from each other to shore up their motivation, they need to know what tactics have the biggest, quickest impact on their brains to give them enough traction to tackle the next thing on the list. To name just a few.</p><p></p><p>Most people can't use merely a list of supplements and a description of the protocol and a pat on the back.</p><p></p><p>When we're so mentally impaired by our physical condition that we can't break it down enough, we can't be organized and systematic enough, we can't do what it takes.</p><p></p><p>Now I know there is a huge range of people tackling these problems. Amen said in his program last night that the proportion of our population with diabetes is now up to 50%.</p><p></p><p>I also know that I could only help a small number of people directly, I could only have appointments with a few, and I could only work effectively with a subset of the overall population who want help, even if I had all the time in the world.</p><p></p><p>Why? The best predictor of success in psychotherapy is the match: how well the two people get along on a personality and temperamental basis. I don't know how this translates into a more arms-length process like coaching, but, for coaching clients, it's an indicator that you'd need to find the right person, with the right style for you, not just the person with the right knowledge.</p><p></p><p>And the same holds true for the coach. One thing experience taught me as a clinical psychologist was to refer certain new patients to people I knew would work better with them. Some people we're better with, others, not so much.</p><p></p><p>But I don't know that yet about coaching. I'd have to learn that as I went along.</p><p></p><p>And I'm 58!</p><p></p><p>Holy shit.</p><p><b>It Depends.</b></p><p></p><p>There's also the question of phase in the process. Some people would be too sick for me to work with, others, too well. I know that sounds weird, but think about it: Some people would need a lot more help than I can give them, they'd need other practitioners, need to talk more frequently than I have time for, etc. Others would be impatient with my lack of detailed knowledge in some areas, like high-level fitness.</p><p></p><p>The critical thing is I would not be acting acting as physician, I would not be acting as a therapist. I would be acting as a health coach, but with specific attention to the mental challenges of people who are ready to work on getting healthier. </p><p></p><p>Geez. That sounds like a lot of work, doesn't it? Am I too old for this?</p><p></p><p></p><p>We all have doubts sometimes, don't we?</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">Health Coaching For the Rest of Us?</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
