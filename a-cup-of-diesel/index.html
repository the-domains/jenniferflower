href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/">Myers-Briggs scale</a>. I guess I always found that a little confusing. But I cleverly devised a solution to the conflict without realizing it.</p><p>I worked and worked and worked and finally became a clinical psychologist. For some people and, I thought, for me, it's a good blend of control and intimacy. Intense intimacy of a certain kind and then the end of the hour. “A certain kind” means with someone but not so much about me.</p><p>Unfortunately, it took me a long time to discover that I was missing. I had trained myself to be restrained, quiet, and almost entirely a listener. These were not the main qualities that I'd started out with in life. </p><p>They were qualities I learned to build because of the situation in my home growing up, so naturally, I thought that was me. </p><p>I was getting retraumatized by my practice. I was increasingly burdened by one session after the next without a good enough way of metabolizing them to proceed in a healthy way. Not that my training didn't work hard to give me ways to avoid that. </p><p>The tools weren't enough. I found the whole system troublesome, partly because I came to see many other ways of intervening in psychological problems. </p><p>I felt like I was living in an intellectual and professional bubble, institute life, into which very little information came from outside, from other areas of research, that really stuck, that really influenced our ways of practicing. </p><p>Or at least not in ways that we discussed with one another.</p><p>Also, I just didn’t have a lifestyle that supported me. I was single, I was working too hard, and I didn’t see an end to it at all. It felt like I could to die in my chair in my office near Riverside Drive, the next time a terrorist decided to bomb New York City. I would never have moved past the first few milestones in my life, never having taken a lot of the risks I expected to take in life.</p><p>It was time to play a lot more over the course of a day.</p><p>So I gradually closed my practice, bought a vintage Airstream motor home and drove off into the sunset, destination unknown. </p><p>Best thing I ever did.</p><p>I have always been liberated in vehicles. I do my best thinking in vehicles. But I never expected that my love of vehicles would take me to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TugboatOwatonna/">biggest fucking tugboat</a> I had ever seen and that a big part of my life would be on it.</p><p>Here’s how it went.</p><p>In 2006, Joe and I met in Mendocino.</p><p>In 2007 we moved 5 times, we sold a house, and we bought a boat.</p><p>A few months later, we got married.</p><p>In 2008 we bought a tugboat. In 2008 we sold the other boat.</p><p>We don’t take steps in the order or with the timing that others might, maybe we’re a little eccentric, I don't know, but we knew what felt right for us.</p><p>Over the course of time, I’ve learned that I don’t make real friends that easily. </p><p>But Joe is an extrovert online. He’s constantly in conversation with someone, whether it’s on The Well, or Facebook, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeflower%22%20%5Cl%20%22LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>, or <a href="http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/tag/joe-flower/">thehealthcareblog.com</a>.</p><p>He’s an old hand online, since before the Web was born. He’s got great social media hygiene in hosting the Writer’s Conference on the Well.</p><p>He’s also an extrovert in passing. He’ll chat anyone up on the street or in the store. Especially if he’s had a margarita or two.</p><p>I, on the other hand, tend to be a real-time and online introvert. I know why that is. It’s because I haven’t yet found the right creative outlet. I can feel that shifting now.</p><p>This blog for instance. If <a href="https://thegrid.io/">TheGrid</a> could just work out the comment thing, I might have some more people to talk to.</p><p>What I’ve found is that the simple circumstances of life, of living near people; of solving local problems; of simply cooking dinner and offering it to others to eat, relaxing together on our deck with our bare feet up in the sun, these things make everything, the confusion, the indecision, the fears, they make the long process of shedding that old self easier. </p><p>In some ways, the boating community falls between Introvert and Extrovert on the Myers-Briggs scale. Many of us love boats for their capacity to whisk us all away from other people, onto the flickering, always changing water, into a neutral realm of color and light and movement. </p><p>At the dock, we are in close quarters, with technical problems that need solving, with drink and stories to share.</p><p>Almost everyone on a boat has good boundaries. Possibly too good. We seek the edge of things, always asking ourselves, should I stay or should I go? </p><p>But in doing those things together, we make the question a lot less pressing.</p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="50"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="51"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="52"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="53"><span data-reactid="54"><!-- react-empty: 55 --><h2 data-reactid="56"><a data-reactid="57">Jennifer Flower</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="58"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="59"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="60"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="61"></div></section></div></div>
