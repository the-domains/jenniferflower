was a kid, the modal winter pic was of someone who’d just gotten a snowball in the face. It happened to me only twice. </p><p>It was just the thing at the time. A snowball in the face.</p><p>Do they still do that? And take pictures of it?</p><p>Maybe it’s just that a snowball in the face is one of the safest ways we have of getting something into the face of the person we’ve been wanting to get something into the face of for years, maybe.</p><p>There aren’t too many occasions when it’s acceptable to shove something onto anyone’s face. Into their face, well, I’m not going there. Right now.</p><p>It’s hard to be aggressive appropriately these days in your average social situation. </p><p>MMA has gained a lot of popularity, but I think it’s an ugly, brutal sport.</p><p>So is trashing each other at parties.</p><p>But I’m old school. And maybe if people like me were a little more accepting of this kind of thing, then we’d have enough ways to blow off steam that the more serious brutality, like school shootings and racist violence wouldn't be “necessary.”</p><p>I know that’s one of the arguments.</p><p>For a while research was showing no relationship between watching violent TV and increases in children’s violence. Then there was some more research showing a correlation. I don't know who’s winning that argument now, but I’m more interested in what it actually feels like to people</p><p>So after you get a snowball in the face, what happens?</p><p>Do you cool off? Warm up? Store resentment for years?</p><p>Does it depend on who you are? Or is there a pretty common pattern of reactions? In the U.S.? Western culture? Globally?</p><p>The questions are important and the answers are important.</p><p>But to me the most important thing is …</p><p>Repair.</p><p>Do you have the skills for repairing the injury you’ve caused?</p><p>Do you have the skills for repairing the injury you’ve suffered?</p><p>Because, as hard as we try to prevent injury, it’s inevitable, whether it was intentional or accidental.</p><p>It’s just what happens in life when we come up against life. And if you try to withdraw enough from life to prevent it, you’re still doing yourself an injury.</p><p>Abandonment and neglect, including self-abandonment, and self-neglect, are hugely injurious to ourselves and to the people around us.</p><p>Just watch someone you love drink themselves into illness or fail to take care of themselves when care is exactly what is needed. Tell me that doesn’t hurt. Deeply.</p><p>One thing I learned in graduate school while training to be a psychologist was this: </p><p>People think they come in to get fixed but what they’re really coming in for is for you to fix Something that doesn’t require them to change.</p><p>People are afraid of change, need I say?</p><p>Sometimes people come into therapy for you to fix someone important in their lives. Your new patient just can’t get that person to come in for therapy.</p><p>As a penultimate resort, people come into therapy for you to fix them. As long as it doesn’t hurt too much and they don’t have to change too much.</p><p>And as a last resort, people come into therapy for you to fix them so they can leave and Be Fixed.</p><p>But here’s the secret.</p><p>What you go into therapy for is to learn to fix.</p><p>Yourself.</p><p>You learn to fix yourself.</p><p>It’s the gift that keeps on giving.</p><p>The times in which you can fix something permanently are far fewer than the times you’ll have to fix something repeatedly.</p><p>It’s kind of a spiraling action, as against a peeling-the-onion action, in which you revisit the same place after going around again, but this time it’s a little deeper and a little different.</p><p>You may not even recognize it as the same place where you already fixed something, but with some reflection (by you on yourself and possibly from someone else back to you) you start to get it, you start to say to yourself, “Self, this is that shit again.”</p><p>But it’s not all shit, there are roses in there too.</p><p>The most valuable lessons you learn in therapy are about growing roses from shit.</p><p>And the interdependence of shit and roses.</p><p>It’s what you start doing while the snow melts.</p></div></article></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="47"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="48"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="49"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="50"><span data-reactid="51"><!-- react-empty: 52 --><h2 data-reactid="53"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="54">Snowball Victories</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="55"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="56"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="57"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
