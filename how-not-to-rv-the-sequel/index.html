<h1>How NOT to RV: The Sequel</h1><p>Years ago I wrote a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rvers-Guide-RVing-Absurd-Guides-ebook/dp/B005V1GITK">How NOT to RV: An RVers Guide to RVing in the Absurd</a>. It’s a funny instructional book full of cautionary tales, laced with hopefulness and philosophical musings.</p><p>I published it on Amazon in a Kindle edition and it’s been toddling along ever since with almost no effort from me. People keep buying it and they keep reviewing it well.</p><p>In fact they keep reviewing it so often that the inevitable regression to the mean has injured it’s rankings. Whereas once before, I had an almost 5-star rating, I now have something closer to 4 stars. This is what happens when you get more and more data points, it's a statistical phenomenon. But there should be some compensation for getting such great engagement!</p><p>It seems that quite a lot of people just need to know how NOT to do it or they’ll never do it at all. The book has turned out to be something of a public service because many people have come to the blog, as I asked, and told their tale of silliness, making mistakes, and having a great time anyway. That was the point!</p><p>I guess I was one of those people. I did a lot of research on RVing before I set out in my vintage Airstream motor home. One usually doesn’t rely on a 16-year-old motor home without being a gearhead but that was part of the adventure for me. </p><p>I really did set out to do it however I did it, not to do it perfectly. I just wanted to know what I might come up against.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rvers-Guide-RVing-Absurd-Guides-ebook/dp/B005V1GITK">How NOT to RV</a> is the first in a series called the <a href="http://hownottoguides.com/">How-NOT-to Guides</a>, a series that I invited others to contribute to for a lion’s share of the royalties but no one ever took me up on it.</p><p>I’m not sure why they didn’t. It’s probably for some of the same reasons that people don’t write books.It’s a pain in the ass if you don’t love writing. And maybe when you’re done, you don’t want someone else to have any control over it.</p><p>On the other hand, if you just love writing and you can tell on yourself in a funny way and you really don’t feel like doing much marketing, it’s a great way to get something done and get paid for it without having to get in the weeds with the production and sequelae.</p><p>But I also kind of missed the point. I didn’t really take seriously what more than a few readers asked me which was, when is the next one coming out? When do we find out what happened next in the life of this person?</p><p>I had written it as a how-to guide, but it was really a Trojan Horse for a lot more than that. It was about transformation, taking risks, and where a journey takes you.</p><p>Well, I’m still on that journey.</p><p>So I guess I’m writing the next one.</p><p>It will still be instructional. About something. But it will also be the other stuff. The what happens next.</p><p>And the invitation is still good. If you think you can write a funny hopeful guide about how NOT to do something while succeeding in teaching how TO do it by implication, then email me at jennifer (at) the change project [dot] com. If I accept your idea and see your writing sample, and then we sign you up, I can give you a small advance and a hefty share of the royalties, reserving some for my effort in marketing the series.</p><p>Right now, I’m just building the brand. If it gets noticeably bigger, the deal may not be so good, so try it now.</p><p>I will also be putting <i>How NOT to RV</i> out in paperback and possibly audiobook. Many have requested it, so why the hell not?</p><p>It just takes time and I’ve got all the time in the world.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">Jennifer Flower</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
