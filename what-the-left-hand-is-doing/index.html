data-reactid="46"><p>When I was in graduate school there was a lot of fuss about laterality. Which hemisphere of the brain does what, that sort of thing.</p><p>You’d constantly hear the story in Psych 101 classes about the folks with split brains, meaning their hemispheres were not connected properly through the corpus collosum, a big band of fibers usually bridging one side of your brain to the other. </p><p>Theirs didn’t.</p><p>The peculiarities that arise with this type of condition are certainly entertaining reading.</p><p>Normally, if you show an image to the left eye, the signal goes to the opposite side of your brain, the hemisphere on your right. And vice versa. Then there’s a lot of visual processing, moving back and forth across the corpus callosum: </p><p>“Hey, did you see what that cat did? Wassup with that?”</p><p>But in split-brain folks it doesn’t work right. The signal goes through the optic chiasm to the opposite side of your head (through a different pathway), but the visual processing doesn’t make it to the other side of your brain.</p><p>So the left side doesn't get the news.</p><p>And vice versa.</p><p><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight?language=en">Jill Bolte Taylor</a> is famous for telling the story of the blissful result of a massive stroke to her left hemisphere, leaving her right hemisphere to run the show.</p><p>The feeling of oneness with the world was ecstatic and overwhelming.</p><p>Makes you think, doesn’t it?</p><p>The left side of your brain is usually associated with linear thinking. The right side,with global-pattern thinking, with creativity.</p><p>This is a vast oversimplification.</p><p>Jill had a big goddam right-brain extravaganza.</p><p>The point is, I want one too, a massive vacation from the left side of my brain.</p><p>And I care less and less what my right hand (the one governed by the left hemisphere) is doing.</p><p>I don’t care so much anymore because I’m reacting extremely to the part of my life that has already happened.</p><p>If I hadn’t been trying so hard to keep my left brain in play ALL THE TIME, I would probably still enjoy my left brain.</p><p>But the left brain isn’t so great at most forms of play. So I’m taking it out of the game.</p><p>My husband, Joe, is a wizard of rationality, from my point of view. But he does have a very poetic side. It’s a shift for him to let it loose, but he can. The most he uses it for is intuition that is highly qualified by his rationality.</p><p>Joe has written a lovely novel that really should be published but which he never quite gets around to publishing, one way or another. </p><p>Too distracting from his mission to help our healthcare system heal itself?</p><p>Too much of a psychic risk, perhaps? </p><p>He used to be a poet. Not a great poet. But he’s a good novelist.</p><p>He’s a very moving singer. When he lets himself really occupy the song.</p><p>I suspect he would be healthier and happier if he spent some time letting that novel out, or writing another one, or singing more.</p><p>That’s easy enough for me to say, though, because I have nothing at risk there. But I'm pretty sure that he’s suffering for lack of right brain activity. </p><p>I am too.</p><p>You?</p><p>I suspect there are drugs that mimic the effects of a left-brain stroke, but I’m too scared of those.</p><p>The best I can do right now is sit down here and write for an hour or two in the mornings.</p><p>The best way I can do that is by not editing myself much.</p><p>And for some reason, it only works if I actually publish what I write. </p><p>By publishing it, I force it out of a circular brain pattern.</p><p>Now, very few people have seen this writing yet but the fact that they could engages different parts of my brain, probably some of the same parts that connect with a listener, and that allow a therapist to influence us.</p><p>For whatever reason, I’m figuring that’s safe to do now, whereas for many years, it didn’t feel safe at all.</p><p>I can’t say I really know why.</p><p>Your brain changes as you get older. Some might say you’re changing your mind, but I’m not sure those map onto each other so well.</p><p>I used to think that changing your mind was primarily a function of effort. Certainly, some of it is. Massive effort.</p><p>But I’m not into massive effort right now because a lot of what I’ve tried through massive effort hasn’t worked very well.</p><p>I’ve felt for much of my life that my massive efforts to improve some things about myself really didn’t get very far. Certain things happened that seemed to have a bigger effect on me and my brain:</p><p>I developed celiac disease, or something close to it.</p><p>My first parent died.</p><p>I entered perimenopause.</p><p>My second parent died.</p><p>I married my husband.</p><p>I entered menopause.</p><p>I suspect that each of these things has had a massive effect on my brain.</p><p>A theory, as my husband would say.</p><p>Theory or no, emergence from a poisonous hormonal soup or no, this is finally where I put my foot down hard.</p><p>On the left side of my brain. </p><p>I’m watching my right brain creep off into the underbrush, checking for permanent injury, scanning for something to eat, and considering.</p></div></article></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="47"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="48"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="49"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="50"><span data-reactid="51"><!-- react-empty: 52 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="53"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="54">What the Left Hand is Doing</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="55"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="56"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="57"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
