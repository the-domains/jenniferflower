data-reactid="46"><p>Meaning is not all it’s cracked up to be.</p><p>Of course, it’s what seems to drive us, make things worth it, give us a sense of satisfaction, or leave us in an open loop when it’s lacking.</p><p>OK, so meaning is pretty important.</p><p>But meaning is mostly prospective and retrospective. If you really look at the experience you’re having in real time, is it full or empty of meaning?</p><p>Sometimes.</p><p>So what the hell am I talking about?</p><p>What about the times that it isn’t?</p><p>Are there Buddhists among us here who will leap to the fore to tell us that meaning is just meaningless so forget about it?</p><p>Those would be reductionist, simpleminded Buddhists, BTW.</p><p>It’s not that meaning has no meaning. Buddhists do not exhort us to live in meaningless worlds.</p><p>They exhort us to remember that the charge on meaning is made up, that even the meaning is a product of our minds.</p><p>But that doesn’t make it meaningless to us. That’s just a definition.</p><p>Meaning takes place in our minds and affects our lives more or less, it’s up to us. Definitions take place in our minds and in our books.</p><p>Like the definitions for Nudge, at the top of the page of my dictionary, and for Nymphomania, at the bottom of the facing page.</p><p>It’s that meaning is both a product and a byproduct of how our psychology works. It’s a little too easy to attach the same importance to both aspects.</p><p>We can and do use meaning to make something happen. It’s a tool in it’s use and in it’s absence.</p><p>Take any presidential race.</p><p>A candidate works a message, crafting a narrative that will carry us along with them, even if they change it over a course of months, days, or hours. <i>(Yes, I used the plural pronoun to create a pronoun of indefinite sex. Picture that.)</i></p><p>What they know is that we use meaning as a device for involving ourselves in our lives and, of course, most importantly, in the great plans that the candidate has for themself.</p><p>But voters are smart. We know meaning is a tool and that it’s often used to obfuscate <i>(isn’t that a great word? It’s kind of onomatopoetic)</i> other meanings, or to enhance an experience. It’s a tool for influence in the drive to power.</p><p>That voters know these things is not enough to prevent being swayed by meaning.</p><p>Meaning can be very loosely assembled and it still works, sometimes better.</p><p>Take anything Donald Trump says, for example. Or, for heaven’s sake, the Crazy Woman who was The War Hero’s running mate. <i>(Sometimes it’s more fun to say the first thing that comes to mind when you can’t remember the word for something. A meaning game. BTW, I have no idea if she's crazy. Or if he's a war hero, for that matter.)</i></p><p>The greater your interest in a candidate, the more you will ignore what you don’t know about them and then project your own meanings onto them.</p><p>Obama understood this when he said, to paraphrase, that many people would be disappointed in him when he was elected because they expected so many disparate things of him.</p><p>Same goes for Donald Trump; or the Crazy Woman, whose language was completely incomprehensible, but her affect wasn’t; or even Hillary Clinton, who is very consistent on some things - like on “getting things done” - but not necessarily on a single moral narrative.</p><p>Hillary is somebody who makes a story in the aggregate and over a long period of time. But the story is a retrospective one, requiring that you go to the next level of abstraction to formulate it. </p><p>Something on the order of: Hillary has always had a drive to act, help, and lead. How she has defined and communicated what’s worth acting on, helping with, and leading toward has changed.</p><p>That’s because, like most people, she’s changed her mind.</p><p>It’s also because she’s responding flexibly - which you may define cynically - to many constituents over a long period of time.</p><p>But if you’re expecting her to be a heroic figure characterized by a single motivation and a single approach, you’ll be disappointed.</p><p>Hillary is chronically disappointing in that way, which makes her a hard leader to adore, for many of us.</p><p>Now Bernie appears to have been more single-minded from what I can tell (warning: I have not been meticulously following either of these folks, I’m just opining from my armchair, as ya do.)</p><p>Bernie has had a consistent view of what works and what doesn’t. And he’s wonderfully clear and inspiring on this. He’s reliable. You feel like you can tell how he really feels and can predict what he’s going to say.</p><p>Which is great for some purposes and not so great in a negotiation.</p><p>In Tetlock’s schema from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-The-Art-Science-Prediction/dp/0804136696">Superforecasters</a>, Bernie is closer to someone who knows one thing, while Hillary is closer to someone who knows a lot of things.</p><p>And Donald Trump may be someone who knows one thing that he is desperately trying to repress.</p><p>People who know one thing do not fare well in <i>Superforecasters</i>. They come across as merely ideologues who are inflexible in the face of evidence and therefore poor forecasters.</p><p>But we’re not talking about forecasters here, we’re talking about leaders.</p><p>Which quality is better?</p><p>Does a leader have to be a superforecaster? Or just have superforecasters on the team?</p><p>It’s great to have a superforecaster on the team. From what I can tell, I’m married to <a href="http://www.imaginewhatif.com/">one</a>. (S<i>hameless plug</i>).</p><p>It helps to be clear about what we’re expecting from our heroes and why.</p><p>We’ve had both kinds of leaders. Could someone weigh in here as to which kind is more successful and under what circumstances?</p><p>Because you have to ask that second question along with the first one.</p><p>Franklin D. Roosevelt. A man who knew a lot of things.</p><p>Hitler. A man who knew one thing.</p><p>Do we agree on this? I’m seriously asking.</p><p>Someone has probably already written on this. Maybe someone can point me to it. Because I’m not going in search right now. I’m too busy.</p><p>Full disclosure: I have a low bar for meaning because I do not have the kind of character for engaging in protracted argument. It just doesn’t interest me.</p><p>What interests me is the evocation of experience.</p><p>Both kinds of leaders can do this well. Compare Franklin and Adolf.</p><p>Meaning can capture the feel of something, and it can be used to evoke the feel of something else, which is what fascinates me about it.</p><p>I certainly don’t want all of us to be like me. We need both kinds of people. Having one without the other would be like living in a soup on the one hand, or living on a grey checkerboard in which nothing touches anything else. (That’s the other hand.)</p><p>Remember when Carl Jung said to his patients, a married couple, that they were in the soup? </p><p>That’s because they came to him in a soup, and he then helped them sort it out into more orderly chunks.</p><p>I guess I don’t know how he would have described it. Probably not like that.</p><p>We’re always working both sides toward the middle.</p><p>Sometimes people come to you in separate boxes and you help them mix it up a little.</p><p>So I guess my point is to remember that meaning is both a tool and an experience.</p><p>It’s both everything and nothing.</p><p>It’s both what we live for and what we live despite, because sometimes meaning, unchecked, can tyrannize.</p><p>See that dictionary?
